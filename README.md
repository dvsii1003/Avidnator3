Currently these are my notes and steps to create an app that will take a directory of Broadcast Wave files and copy them to a new directory sorted in folders by timecode. It will then append track numbers to the end of the filenames. This is to help facilitate ease of mapping tracks when imported into an AVID editing environment.

This is designed around BWF files recorded either in a DAW or a Sound Devices recorder

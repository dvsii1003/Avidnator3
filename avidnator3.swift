// Avidnator 3 Swift code

// note: specify folder options?

// possibly have user input Show name, date for folder creation

// get source directory path from user input

// get destination directory path from user input


// read metadata from each file in source directory, spcifically timecode (BWF)

// create folders in destination directory based on timecode (BWF) under the Show name and date folders

// copy files from source directory to destination directory based on timecode (BWF)

// iterate through each file in destination directory and append track number to end of file name

// note: can we use drag and drop from desktop for source and destination directories?

// nate: can this be a web app? Is javascript the best language for this?

// note: can we use a GUI for user input?

// note: How can I make this more flexable for other users?
